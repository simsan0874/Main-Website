<p>HTML forms are used to collect user input.</p>

<p>The &lt;form&gt; element defines an HTML form.</p>

<p>HTML forms contain form elements.</p>

<p>Form elements are different types of input elements, checkboxes, radio buttons, submit buttons, and more.</p>

<p>The &lt;input&gt; element is the most important form element.</p>

<p>The &lt;input&gt; element has many variations, depending on the type attribute.</p>

<p>The types of input elemets include the following.</p>

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Type</th><th>Description</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>text</td><td>Defines normal text input</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>radio</td><td>Defines radio button input (for selecting one of many choices)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>submit</td><td>Defines a submit button (for submitting the form)</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>&lt;input type="text"&gt; defines a one-line input field for text input.</p>

<p>&lt;input type="radio"&gt; defines a radio button.</p>

<p>Radio buttons let a user select ONE of a limited number of choices.</p>

<p>&lt;input type="submit"&gt; defines a button for submitting a form to a form-handler.</p>

<p>The form-handler is typically a server page with a script for processing input data.</p>

<p>The form-handler is specified in the form's action attribute.</p>

<p>The action attribute defines the action to be performed when the form is submitted.</p>

<p>The common way to submit a form to a server, is by using a submit button.</p>

<p>Normally, the form is submitted to a web page on a web server.</p>

<p>The method attribute specifies the HTTP method (GET or POST) to be used when submitting the forms.</p>

<p>You can use GET (the default method) if the form submission is passive (like a search engine query), and without sensitive information.</p>

<p>When you use GET, the form data will be visible in the page address.</p>

<p>You should use POST if the form is updating data, or includes sensitive information (password).</p>

<p>POST offers better security because the submitted data is not visible in the page address.</p>

<p>To be submitted correctly, each input field must have a name attribute.</p>

<p>The &lt;fieldset&gt; element groups related data in a form.</p>

<p>The &lt;legend&gt; element defines a caption for the &lt;fieldset&gt; element.</p>
