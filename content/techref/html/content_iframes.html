<p>An iframe is used to display a web page within a web page.</p>

<p>The src attribute specifies the URL (web address) of the iframe page.</p>

<p>Use the height and width attributes to specify the size.</p>

<p>The attribute values are specified in pixels by default, but they can also be in percent (like "80%").</p>

<p>By default, an iframe has a black border around it.</p>

<p>To remove the border, add the style attribute and use the CSS border property.</p>

<p>With CSS, you can also change the size, style and color of the iframe's border.</p>

<p>An iframe can be used as the target frame for a link.</p>

<p>The target attribute of the link must refer to the name attribute of the iframe.</p>
