<p>In HTML, images are defined with the &lt;img&gt; tag.</p>

<p>The &lt;img&gt; tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.</p>

<p>The src attribute specifies the URL (web address) of the image.</p>

<p>The alt attribute specifies an alternate text for an image, if the image cannot be displayed.</p>

<p>The alt attribute provides alternative information for an image if a user for some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader).</p>

<p>If a browser cannot find an image, it will display the alt text.</p>

<p>The alt attribute is required. A web page will not validate correctly without it.</p>

<p>You can use the style attribute to specify the width and height of an image.</p>

<p>The values are specified in pixels (use px after the value).</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can use width and height attributes.</p>

<p>If not specified, the browser expects to find the image in the same folder as the web page.</p>

<p>However, it is common to store images in a sub-folder. You must then include the folder name in the src attribute.</p>

<p>Some web sites store their images on image servers.</p>

<p>In this case, the full URL (including HTTP) must be set in the src attribute to reference this image.</p>

<p>To use an image as a link, simply nest the &lt;img&gt; tag inside the &lt;a&gt; tag.</p>

<p>Use the &lt;map&gt; tag to define an image-map. An image-map is an image with clickable areas.</p>

<p>The name attribute of the &lt;map&gt; tag is associated with the &lt;img&gt;'s usemap attribute and creates a relationship between the image and the map.</p>

<p>The &lt;map&gt; tag contains a number of &lt;area&gt; tags, that defines the clickable areas in the image-map.</p>
