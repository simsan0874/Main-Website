<p>Links are found in nearly all web pages. Links allow users to click their way from page to page.</p>

<p>HTML links are hyperlinks.</p>

<p>A hyperlink is a text or an image you can click on, and jump to another document.</p>

<p>In HTML, links are defined with the &lt;a&gt; tag.</p>

<p>The href attribute specifies the destination address (http://www.andrewmsims0874.com/)</p>

<p>The link text is the visible part (Visit our HTML tutorial).</p>

<p>Clicking on the link text, image, or element, will send you to the specified address.</p>

<p>When you move the mouse over a link, two things will normally happen:</p>

<ul>
<li>The mouse arrow will turn into a little hand</li>
<li>The color of the link element will change</li>
</ul>

<p>By default, a link will appear like this (in all browsers):</p>

<ul>
<li>An unvisited link is underlined and blue</li>
<li>A visited link is underlined and purple</li>
<li>An active link is underlined and red</li>
</ul>

<p>You can change the default colors, by using styles.</p>

<p>The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.</p>

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Target Value</th><th>Description</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>_blank</td><td>Opens the linked document in a new window or tab</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>_self</td><td>Opens the linked document in the same frame as it was clicked (this is default)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>_parent</td><td>Opens the linked document in the parent frame</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>_top</td><td>Opens the linked document in the full body of the window</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>framename</td><td>Opens the linked document in a named frame</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>HTML bookmarks are used to allow readers to jump to specific parts of a Web page.</p>

<p>Bookmarks are practical if your website has long pages.</p>

<p>To make a bookmark, you must first create the bookmark, and then add a link to it.</p>

<p>When the link is clicked, the page will scroll to the location with the bookmark.</p>

<p>Create a bookmark with the id attribute of an element.</p>

<p>Then, add a link to the bookmark (referencing the id in the form "#id" in the href) from within the same page.</p>
