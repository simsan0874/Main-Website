<p>Browsers automatically add an empty line before and after a paragraph.</p>

<p>You cannot be sure how HTML will be displayed.</p>

<p>Large or small screens, and resized windows will create different results.</p>

<p>With HTML, you cannot change the output by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code.</p>

<p>The browser will remove extra spaces and extra lines when the page is displayed.</p>

<p>Any number of spaces, and any number of new lines, count as only one space.</p>

<p>Forgetting the end tag can produce unexpected results or errors.</p>
